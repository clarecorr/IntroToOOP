            //All objects from a class will have the same number and type of states
            //BUT each instance can have it's own unique values

            //ClassName objectName = new ClassName();
            Cat mittens = new Cat();
            //To create a new object, we use special method called a CONSTRUCTOR

            //Thinking about objects in real life create thre examples of objects
            //Your objects should have five states and five behaviors

            //Object One: Building
            //States: Height, Windows, Walls, Rooms, Roof
            //Behaviors: HousesPeople, GetsBuilt, CastsShadows, AbsorbsSunlight, ProvidesProtection

            //Object Two: Meeting
            //States: invitees, topics, startTime, location, purpose
            //Behaviors: AllowsDecisionsToBeMade, FacilitatesSolutions, BringsPeopleTogether, GetsPlanned
